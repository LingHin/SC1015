# SC1015 Mini Project: Medical Condition Predictor

## About

Our team's main objective was to employ machine learning models to make processing of raw medical data easier for medical personnel, by determining the relationship between 
medical conditions and presence of diseases in patients.

The dataset we have chosen was taken from Kaggle, titled [Hospital Mortality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yashgupta24/hospital-moratality-analysis/notebook).

## Problem Definition

- Do any of the medical conditions have correlation with any diseases?
- What models can we use to best predict this relationship>

## Models Used

- 1. Logistic Regression
- 2. Decision Tree
- 3. MissForest
- 4. RandomForest

## Conclusion

- 

## Lessons learnt

- MissForest is a good method for filling in NA values to ensure consistency in the dataset
